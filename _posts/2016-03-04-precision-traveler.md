People have asked me to make an article about traveling. From tickets, hotels, airlines, frequently flyer programs, luxurious travels, business travels and beginners. Little bit about me - I have been traveling around the world for the last 16 years, completing almost 72 times around the world. I travel economy, business and first. For work, business, and pleasure. Let me tell you that nothing fits all. But you can make the best out of it with using Precision Travel.

Let's get started with the basics.

**Tip 1** - Understanding the miles system
In a few words, airline miles are like any other rewards program. You get points for buying things, and exchange them later on for buying things for free.
You can get airline miles in two ways: using your credit card or by using the free loyalty card from any of the teams you find. I would recommend joining the 3 mains team which are One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1b501325-fbf7-4e9c-86a1-3e8b7fc0050c.jpg)

In the airline world mainly we have three main temas known as: One world, Star Alliance and Sky Team Alliance. There are many airlines in each team. You only need to choose one from each team, so every time you fly, you collect points with those 3 companies. 

**For USA/Canada**: 

_One world__:_ @americanairlines 

_Star Alliance:_@united @aircanada  

_Sky team:_ @Delta 

**For Europe:**

_One world:_ @britishairways @iberia @feelfinnair @airberlin @s7airlines\_official 

_Star Alliance:_ @lufthansa @turkishairlines @austrianairlines @brussels\_airlines @croatia.airlines @scandinavianairline @flylot @tapportugal @aegeanairlines and (Swiss Airline, Adria Airline)

The thumb rule is that you chose the airline of your country, which you would naturally travel the most with, to get the most out of it. 
If you frequently travel between Europe and USA, I would personally suggest to chose American airlines like United, American, or Delta because you get a lot of upgrades and perks with those airlines.

Tip 3 - Selecting a Credit card 
Credit Card (CC) points with airline miles are a little different. 
Last week, one friend of mine asked me about the points systems with credit cards. So I told him to check with his bank or credit card company a few things: 

1\. Points you get for dollars spent 

2\. Insurance (whether your is ticket is insured in case of flight delays, cancelation, luggage loss, death, or any accidents, etc.) 

3\. Annual fees (how much the CC charges you a year for that particular card) 

4\. Whether you get a Priority pass card with it. (Priority Pass Select is specially designed for customers who receive their membership through a US Financial Institution. Priority Pass Select Members have access to over 850 airport lounges around the world, including hundreds across North and South America and a true global spread across the rest of the world.) 

5\. Check if the CC company has agreements with airlines. If yes, make sure some of the previous benefits are included.

6\. Whether the CC gives benefits with airlines or hotels. 
Insurance is an important factor if you travel a lot. It saves you a lot of money if your luggage is misplaced, or your ticket (tkt) is cancelled.
Because you probably use your CC more than you buy airlines tkts, it's usually easier to get points through a credit card than an airline rewards program. 

Note: my next post will be about my realizations with CC and FFP - what I use and what works best for me.
